        <p class="pad-t">
          Macro Print helps brands reach their target audience using innovative
          and extremely effective advertising strategies – changeable ad banners
          on truck trailers. We turn your trailer into moving advertising spaces
          that are visible from three sides, on every road and every city 24/7.
        </p>
        <p class="pad-t">
          Due to the triple-secured system and easy handling of the banner feed,
          there is no faster advertising solution in this area.
        </p>
        <p class="pad-t">
          This advertising option reaches more customers than handbills. With
          customized design and high-quality printing – our solution is a real
          eye-catcher. Trucks never stop neither will your advertising. We have
          been successfully operating internationally for years and in 2020 due
          to the strong demand from the North American market for trailer
          advertising, we founded Macro Print in the USA.
